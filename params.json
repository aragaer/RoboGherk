It runs\r\non top of Android instrumentation test cases inside the Android emulator.\r\nRoboGherk Features subclass the `Feature` class, provide the starting\r\nactivity, and specify steps with Given(), When(), Then(), and And().  For\r\nexample:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npackage com.leandog.robogherk.exercises;\r\n\r\nimport com.leandog.robogherk.Feature;\r\nimport com.leandog.robogherk.example_app.FirstActivity;\r\n\r\npublic class MyFeature extends Feature {\r\n\r\n    public MyFeature() {\r\n        super(FirstActivity.class);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void test_A_working_scenario() {\r\n        Given(\"I am on the HelloRoboGherk activity\");\r\n        Then(\"my 'parameter' should work too\");\r\n        And(\"things that should have occured in setup have\");\r\n        And(\"I go to another screen\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSteps are dynamically loaded from MyFeatureSteps; for example, the first\r\nGiven() line invokes the I\\_am\\_on\\_the\\_HelloRoboGherk\\_activity() method.\r\n\r\nBuilding\r\n--------\r\n\r\n* Run 'ant build' from a clone of the git repository.\r\n\r\nDevelopment\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nWe did incremental development using an existing app. We didn't write unit\r\ntests for everything, but all new features should be test-driven.\r\n\r\nThe exercises are acceptance tests on RoboGherk that run against the included\r\nexample app. \r\n\r\nNote on Patches/Pull Requests\r\n-----------------------------\r\n* Fork the project.\r\n* Test-drive your feature addition or bug fix. If you need help with \r\n  unit-testing Android, start a conversation by email. We'll help. \r\n* Send us a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.\r\n\r\nWho are we?\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nWe're the maddogs @ leandog.com. Making the world a better place for mobile\r\ndevelopment. :)","name":"Robogherk","google":"","tagline":"Gherkin-like acceptance testing for Android in plain Java."}
